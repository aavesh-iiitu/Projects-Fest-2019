 <h1> RC Aircraft</h1>
INTRODUCTION

A radio-controlled aircraft (often called RC aircraft or RC plane) is a small flying machine that is controlled remotely by an operator on the ground using a hand-held radio transmitter. The transmitter communicates with a receiver within the craft that sends signals to servomechanisms (servos) which move the control surfaces based on the position of joysticks on the transmitter.

Planes fly by virtue of Bernoulli's principle on their wings. Air being pushed under the wings only accounts for a small portion of the lift forces that make an airplane fly. The real lift forces results from the partial vaccum created above the wings (Bernoulli's principle). In effect, a plane rises on account that it wings are being "sucked up" from above.
To get the Bernoulli effect (and to lift the plane), the wings must expose a larger surface on top than below the wing. A curved wing does just that.
Second, we need to maintain a flow of air over and under the wings. This is the job of the engine, which pulls the plane and its wings forward, using a propeller. Once the airplane accelerates to take to a speed sufficient to generate enough lift for the airplane to fly, the airplane can take off.

**RC AIRPLANE CONTROLS**

Major functions of different componenets in RC Airplane controls are:
•	THROTTLE
Throttle controls the speed of the engine and hence how fast or slow the propeller turns.


•	Elevators
The elevators are the hinged section of the tailplane, or horizontal stabiliser, at the very rear of the airplane and are the single most important control surface. 
Elevators control the horizontal pitch attitude of the airplane, in other words whether the nose of the plane points upwards or downwards.


•	Ailerons
Ailerons control the roll of the airplane about its longitudinal axis.
Ailerons work in pairs and are found on the trailing (rear) edge of the wing, and they work opposite to each other i.e. when one aileron moves up, the other one moves down and vice versa.


•	Rudder
The rudder is the hinged section of the fin, or vertical stabiliser, at the rear of the airplane. 
It's used for directional control by changing the yaw of the airplane, and works in the correct sense i.e. moving the rudder to the left causes the airplane to turn left and vice versa.


•	Flaps
Flaps are located on the trailing edge of each wing, between the aileron and fuselage. They're used to generate more lift at slower flying speeds and, at greater deflection, to slow the airplane down close to landing by causing excessive drag. 


•	Retracts
Retractable landing gear (undercarriage) is landing gear that folds away into the airplane's wings or fuselage once the plane has taken off.


**CONCLUSION**
The major use of this Rc aircrafts is in case of brutal disasters, man made or natural, for providing instant relief to victims .Rc aircrafts can be a major asset in delivering food packets and in aerial surveillance.
